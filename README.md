Here is a personal project of mine. It is a MEAN stack app with Angular4. The purpose of this app is right now is to demonstrate the foundation of any app performing authentication, user management, content management complete with custom fields and custom content forms. It is sort of a MEAN Stack CMS if you will. I intend to give it some purpose and publish it to the app store. For now it is a demonstration of the type of coding I have done with past projects that I am not allowed to show off.
